## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
The MechaCar_mpg.csv dataset contained mpg test results from 50 prototype Mechacars. The prototypes were produced using various design specifications to determine the ideal vehicle performance. Several metrics such as vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain, and ground clearance were collected for each prototype vehicle. R was used to run a multiple linear regression model to determine if mpg (miles per gallon) can be predicted for a Mechacar vehicle using vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain, and ground clearance. The output of our model can be seen below:

Based on the above output, our resulting model could be written as:

### mpg = 6.3(vehicle_length) + 0.0012(vehicle_height) + .069(spoiler_angle) + 3.5(ground_clearance) - 3.4 (AWD) - 104

1) Vehicle length, ground clearance, and the intercept value are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. In other words, the vehicle length and ground clearance do have a significant impact on the mpg of a Mechacar. The intercept being significant tells us that this intercept term explains a significant amount of variability of mpg when all of our other variables are set to 0.  
2) Since our model returned a p-value (5.53e-11) that is less than our significance level of 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis that our slope would be equal to 0. Thus, the slope of this linear model would not be equal to 0.
3) According to our r-squared value of 0.71, roughly 71% of the variability  of mpg is explained using our linear model. However, since this model only returned 2 significant variables this could show evidence of overfitting. Thus, this model might perform well with our current dataset but would fail to predict future data correctly. Furthermore, the fact that our intercept was included as a significant variable could also mean that there are other variables not included in this model that could help explain the variability of the mpg. 

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
The MechaCar Suspension_Coil.csv contained the results from multiple production lots. The weight capacities of different suspension coils were tested to see if the manufacturing process is consistent across the multiple production lots. R was used to create two summary statistics tables of suspension coil's PSI, one across all manufacturing lots and another for each lot. 

### Summary for Manufacturing Lots in Total
Based on design specficiations for the MechaCar, the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. The results of the summary table for all manufacturing lots can be seen below.

Our variance for all manufacturing lots is 62.3, which does fall below the 100 pounds per square inch threshold. All manufacturing lots in total do meet this design specfication. 

### Summary for Individual Manufacturing Lots
In order to determine if each lot met this requirement individually, the results were first grouped by lot ID and then individual summary statistics were found. The results are as shown below.

Lot 1 and Lot 2 both have a variance that falls way below the 100 pounds per square inch threshold, so both of these lots do meet the design specificiation. However, lot 3 has a variance that is way above the threshold. This lot does not meet the design specificiation and shows evidence of an inconsistent manufacturing process.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
R was used to run different t-tests to determine if the PSI for all of the manufacturing lots and each lot individually is statistically different from our expected population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch.
### Assumptions
Before running the t-tests, I checked to make sure that our data passed all five of our assumptions for a one-sample t-test. The PSI data is numerical and continuous. Our sample data were selected randomly using the sample_n() function in r. The sample size used was 50 which is relatively large, and the variance of our data is similar. Lastly, I tested if our data is normally distributed by graphing the PSI data using the geom_density() function on R. The density plot (shown below) does look like a normal bell curve with roughly equal amounts of data on both sides of the mean.

### PSI across all Manufacturing Lots
The first t-test performed tested if the PSI from all manufacturing lots was statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch. A random sample of 50 was taken from our original suspension data. The significance level used for this test was 0.05. Our t-test results showed the following:

![This is an image](https://github.com/dsilvaggio/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Screen%20Shot%202022-06-03%20at%203.41.38%20PM.png)

Our p-value of 0.2173 was greater than our significance level, thus we failed to reject the null hypothesis. In other words, there is not enough evidence to say that these means are statistically different. 

### PSI from Lot 1
The next t-test performed tested if the PSI from just Manufacturing Lot 1 was statistically different from the population mean(1,500 pounds per square inch). A subset of our data was taken to get only the data from lot 1. The significance level used for this test was again 0.05. Our t-test results showed the following:

![This is an image](https://github.com/dsilvaggio/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Screen%20Shot%202022-06-03%20at%203.47.10%20PM.png)

Our p-value of 1 was much greater than our significance level, thus we failed to reject the null hypothesis. In other words, there is not enough evidence to say that the PSI from Lot 1 is statistically different from the population mean.

### PSI from Lot 2
The above steps were then repeated for Manufacturing Lot 2. The t-test results show the following:

![This is an image](https://github.com/dsilvaggio/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Screen%20Shot%202022-06-03%20at%203.49.57%20PM.png)

Similarly to Lot 1, our p-value of 0.6072 was much greater than our significance level, thus we failed to reject the null hypothesis. There was also not enough evidence to say that the PSI from Lot 2 is statistically different from the population mean.

### PSI from Lot 3
The above steps were then finally repeated for Manufacturing Lot 3. The t-test results for this lot showed something rather interesting:

![This is an image](https://github.com/dsilvaggio/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Screen%20Shot%202022-06-03%20at%203.51.57%20PM.png)

Here our p-value of 0.041 is less than our significance level. We have enough evidence to reject our null hypothesis. This means that there is evidence to show that the PSI for Manufacturing lot 3 is statistically different than our expected population mean.
